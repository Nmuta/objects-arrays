4) Question: What would happen if I specify myArray[100]?
A new element with the index 100 would be created. Everything between myArray[4] and myArray[100] would return "undefined".

5) Question: What would happen if I specify myArray[-1]?
I didn't think this was possible, but it did run when I created myArray[-1] and set it to a value.
When I then returned myArray, it returned the positive indexed values, then at the end it had ''"-1": 0' It made the negative index become a string.
